title: Statistics for Product Management
---

<p>This aim of this book is to help people who create digital products understand some of the basic maths and statistics required to manage and improve them. Being able to collect metrics and make 'data informed' decisions is a fundamental part of the job, but it isn't something everyone has much background in. For many of us maths is something we left behind in high school, and we may lack confidence in crunching numbers or judging the outcome of experiments.</p>

<p>The book is not a comprehensive primer in statistics, or a how-to analytics guide - many excellent examples of these already exist, and some are listed in the *Further Reading* section. It covers some fairly elementary mathematics like percentages and averages, key statistical concepts like distributions and confidence intervals, and some more advanced topics like multivariate testing. It's many years since I studied science and I am not any kind of professional statistician, so writing the book has been a learning exercise for me. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.</p>
